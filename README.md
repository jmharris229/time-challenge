# time-challenge

A basic clock implementation to add minutes using Ruby, without the use of any native date functions. Takes a string of time as argument 1 and a amount of minutes for argument 2. The result should return a new time string of the original format with the added minutes.

To run the tests.

- Download repo
- from directory run `ruby challenge.rb`

You should get an output of the results of the tests.
